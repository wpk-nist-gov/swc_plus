* Mod 1 
The idea is for this module to cover from beginning to end the setup of a
python project which performs a simple calculation, contains a command line
program (maybe), contains documentation, and is installable via pip and/or conda.
** Things to include
   - conda env
   - Python module setup
     - Good docstrings...
     - Testing
   - Documentation schemes
     - Doc strings (numpy style?)
     - sphinx autodoc
     - markdown with code execution
   - testing suit
     - I like pytest, but whatever
     - hooks?
   - Refactor to package
   - setup.py
   - Travis?
   - pip install from local, pip install from github
   - python 2/3 support via six or future


* Other libraries
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - builduing command line programs
  - xarray
  - scipy/numpy+
    - optimize
    - interpolate/spline
    - ndimage


* My code is slow!
  - multiprocessing
  - Numba
  - cython
  - pybind11
  - setup.py


  
* Conda
  - all the conda

* Mod 2 
  - Submodules
  - pypi/conda/anaconda cloud
